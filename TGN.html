					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<h4>Project Brief</h4>
					<p>The Graide Network connects secondary school teachers with undergraduate Education majors who want to gain experience grading assignments. My team was the second team to work with them and we built upon the work that they did designing the product experience for the teachers. Our focus was on the undergraduate students, who are known as Graiders. For teachers, the value of having someone like a virtual TA look through your students' assignments was obvious and their concerns had mostly been addressed by the previous team's work.</p>
					<h4>Problem and Approach</h4>
					<p>
					The primary challenge we found was how to create value for the users as college students aspiring to be teachers. In our early initial interviews with Graiders, we discovered that they saw inherent value in the experience of grading actual papers. In education programs, a lot of emphasis is placed on pedagogy and classroom experience, but the sausage-making day to day grind of grading is often overlooked and they were excited to see how teachers use rubrics, create assignments and generally enthusiastic about the opportunity to grade students' work. We interviewed 5?6? Graiders who had received a variety of feedback on their grading from the first year pilot program and found that regardless of their ability, they were eager to grade, even with the cumbersome system that they were using that involved an auto-populating spreadsheet template they had to manually navigate and enter information into. Ultimately, because they were education majors, they were looking for any opportunity to become better teachers and they didn't know what they didn't know. Given their altruistic enthusiasm and lack of experience, our challenge was to create an experience that not only made grading easier, but actively propelled them to being better teachers when they were in the classroom themselves. 
					</p>
					<h4>Solution</h4>
					<p>
					Our strategy was two-fold. First, my team's first priority was to create value for the graiders both short-term and long-term. This meant streamlining the grading process as much as possible, while building in features that drew from what we learned from experienced teachers about their grading workflow. Second, while we were working on the project, The Graide Network finalized their development team. We had the opportunity to meet with their developers, understand their technical priorities and delivered them three user-tested concepts ranging from an MVP I designed that could be immediately implemented, to a fuller-featured, idealistic digital grading solution prototype. We also created a prioritized roadmap, based on our test findings for features that could be progressively added to the product for subsequent product iterations.
